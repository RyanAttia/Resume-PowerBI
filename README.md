# üìä Interactive Resume in Power BI

An interactive resume dashboard built entirely in **Microsoft Power BI**, designed to showcase my experience, technical skills, and projects in a visual, dynamic, and user-friendly format. This project goes beyond the limitations of a traditional resume by allowing viewers to interact with the data and explore my background through filters, visuals, and drill-through pages.

## üîç Overview

This Power BI dashboard serves as a living, interactive resume with features that include:

- **Multi-page layout** displaying education, skills, experience, and projects.
- **Interactive filters** for role, skill category, timeframe, and project type.
- **Dynamic visuals** like bar charts, treemaps, KPI cards, and tooltips.
- **Custom DAX measures** to calculate:
  - Years of experience per skill
  - Project count by domain
  - Tool usage frequency
  - Proficiency levels

## üß† Data Modeling

The resume‚Äôs data model uses a relational (star schema) structure to maintain clarity and efficiency. Tables such as `Skills`, `Projects`, and `Tools Used` are linked using well-defined relationships. Power Query was used to clean and transform the data, while DAX powered the calculated metrics and KPIs that drive the visualizations.

## üé® Design Highlights

- Custom theme with clear, professional visuals and accessible color palettes
- Slicers and drill-through pages to enhance user interactivity
- Tooltip-enhanced visuals for deeper context on hover
- Responsive layout that guides users through a non-linear storytelling experience

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- Microsoft Power BI Desktop  
- Power Query  
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)  
- Data modeling using star schema  
- Custom visual formatting and themes

## üí° Why This Project?

This interactive resume not only communicates my background in a visually engaging way, but also demonstrates my ability to design, model, and implement advanced Power BI dashboards. It merges storytelling with technical skill, and acts as both a personal branding tool and a showcase of data visualization proficiency.
